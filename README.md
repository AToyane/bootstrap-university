Bootstrap University
====================

In-progress tutorials for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), starting with a BS101 guide for &quot;getting started&quot;, open for community feedback.

## What's included

* [BS 101: Getting started with Bootstrap](https://github.com/markdotto/bootstrap-university/blob/master/bs-101.md)

## What's next

Though not final, this is the gist of what's next:

* BS 102: Scaffolding, the grid, and layouts
* BS 103: Javascript in Bootstrap
* BS 104: Customizing with LESS

## Ideas?

This is all rough and a huge work in progress for us. If you have feedback, open an issue, submit a pull request, or mention us [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/twbootstrap).
